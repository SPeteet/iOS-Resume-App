Hi there. This is my iOS resume app.

It showcases through multiple pages within the app, a little about me, work history, education, projects, and career goals.
I implemented page navigation using button actions.

On the projects page, I implemented a UIScrollView to navigation between multiple pictures where each describes a project I've completed. I also implemented additional button controls to tie a forward and back arrow to navigate between the pictures.
